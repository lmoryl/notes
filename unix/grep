BASICS
======
grep -[opts] [pattern] [loc1 loc2 ...]

* reads from standard input if no loc arguments are provided

OPTIONS
=======
* -i: ignore case of pattern
* -H: always print filenames with output lines (so xargs grep -H can work as a filter)
* -A [num], -B [num]: print [num] lines of after and before context for each match
* -v: exclude any lines that match the pattern
* -c: count lines

NOTES
-----
If you want to find a string that starts with a hyphen, use:
  * grep '[-]...' file
This passes [-]... to grep without shell expansion, and grep sees that as a regex
