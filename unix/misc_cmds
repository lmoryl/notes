tr domain range:
  * reading from stdin, maps each char in domain to corresponding char in range (assuming same number of chars in each)
  * -s: compress all repeated characters to one (so tr -s \n reduces all multi-\n's to single \n)
  * -d: delete (e.g. tr -d \r)
  * -c: complement (e.g. tr -cd '[:alnum:]')

uniq: 
  * Eliminates all adjacent duplicate rows from input.  Only eliminates all duplicate rows if sorted (can also be achieved by sort -u)

xxd:
  * dump to hex

split infile outpref:
  * split file into parts, default 1000 lines (orig is kept) (note cat outpref?? > filename reassembles file too)
  * 

tee:

xargs cmd:
  * Treat each whitespace-separated text block as a filename and execute cmd on said file
  * -p: prompt for each file
  * -I: specify a name to stand in for real file names.  e.g. ls | xargs -I f mv f ~/newdir
    * TODO: how to do stuff like batch file name changing?

cut: 
  * Extract one or more columns from a file.  Default delimiter is \t
  * -d: specify delimiter (in single quotes)
  * -b, -c, -f: select only these (bytes, characters, fields) respectively
    * N: the Nth thing
    * N-: the Nth thing to the end of the line
    * N-M: From the Nth to the Mth thing
    * -M: from the 1st through the Mth thing
